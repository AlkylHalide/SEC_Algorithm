## Acknowledgements

As a Belgian exchange student, given the opportunity to work on such a project at one of the best schools in Sweden, I need to thank a few people who made this possible and who have supported me during the work.

First and foremost I'd like to thank my supervisor at Chalmers University of Technology, Elad Michael Schiller, for giving me the chance to work on this project, and for guiding me along the way. Secondly I'd like to thank Olaf Landsiedel for helping me in times of need, when I needed help, tips, and guidance when facing hundreds of software bugs.

I also want to show my appreciation for my Swedish friends in the Master Thesis workroom at Chalmers. Daniel Moreau, David Alm, Robin Karlsson and Henning Phan. They were great colleagues from the start, and they have become friends.

Last but certainly not least, I wish to show my utmost appreciation to all the persons at my home university of KU Leuven at Thomas More Geel, who helped me a great deal to be able to spend the past semester in Sweden. They even kindly provided their assistance during my stay here, whenever I needed their advice. These persons include, but are not limited to; Peter Karsmakers, Patrick Colleman, Hilde Lauwereys, Geert Van Ham, Patricia Van Genechten and Isabelle Moons.
