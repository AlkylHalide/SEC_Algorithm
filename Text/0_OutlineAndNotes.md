Wat is moeilijkheid ontwerpen algoritme TinyOs (distributed networking algemeen): klassiek debugging, op F7 drukken en lijn per lijn afgaan, werkt niet. Speciale debugging tools nodig.

Context vermelden: onderzoek paper gesubsidieerd via KARYON project; wat is het, doel, welk puzzelstukje is dit algoritme en resultaten in het grotere geheel?

Acknowledge problems that arose during the work: no or little support to be found for TinyOS. E.g.: I can add this in the part about future work → in presentation of current state of TinyOS by Phil Levis (Lessons Learned from 10 years of TinyOS development), he mentions the general move away from TinyOS to more accessible and supported OS' such as Contiki. This leads to the conclusion that future work will have to convert my code to Contiki-compatible code.
ALSO, on tinyos wiki itself found this:

“Generally, the best place to start is with the authors of the paper describing it. Even if they don't maintain an implementation, chances are they are aware of existing versions of it. Emailing tinyos-help isn't usually effective.”

Contiki vs TinyOS:

Central research question.

Thesis is an original contribution to knowledge:
You have identified a worthwhile problem or question which has not been previously answered
You have solved the problem or answered the question

Keep to the point
A concise paper or thesis requires keeping the main points in mind--ONLY include background information, data, discussion that is relevant to these points

You may develop computer programs, prototypes, or other tools as a means of proving your points, but remember, the thesis is not about the tool, it is about the contribution to knowledge

Why using TinyOS and not Contiki for example? Ask Elad why he suggested TinyOS.

In original paper of algorithm are a few “lemma's” described, which form the proof for some of the statements made concerning the advantages of the algorithm. In “expected results” section we can use these lemma's to form an idea of the results we're expecting to see out of the simulations and experiments.

Researchers describe WSNs as

“An exciting emerging domain of deeply networked systems of low-power wireless motes with a tiny amount of CPU and memory, and large federated networks for high-resolution sensing of the environment.”
