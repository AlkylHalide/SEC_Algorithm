SETUP FOR THE SIMULATIONS
-------------------------

Four versions of the algorithm:
1. First-Attempt
2. Advanced-No-ECC
3. Advanced-ECC
4. Advanced-ECC-Multihop

### CONTINUOUS RUNNING SIMULATIONS ###
Each version runs continuously in Cooja, outputting information to the console
Measure the amount of errors occur
Reset simulation with random seed, go again

  --> Let counter go until 10000 each simulation
  --> Run 10 simulations, if possible 50

Keep track of amount of errors per simulation
Keep track of speed of specific algorithm, how fast are messages being send

==> End results should give overview of overhead vs. performance

            **Performance measures: speed and accuracy*

### LIBREPLAY ###
Insert, duplicate, reorder messages for each version

Prove that algorithm is self-stabilizing: go to stable state after recovering
from each error
