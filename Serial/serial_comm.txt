# How to setup serial communication with motes in Cooja

1) Set up simulation, at least one mote needs to send data to the serial port

2) Right-click mote, select "Mote tools for Sky X" --> "Serial Socket (SERVER)"

3) Serial Socket (SERVER) windows pops up, adjust port if needed and select "Connect"
	Let's say you set the port at 60002

4) Open terminal and type following command:

	java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm network@localhost:PORT_NUMBER

	So in this case PORT_NUMBER needs to be changed to 60002
